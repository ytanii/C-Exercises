//  Is the following if statement legal?
// if (n >= 1 <= 10)
// printf("n is between 1 and 10\n");
// If so, what does it do when n is equal to 0?
// 
// The statement is legal but confusing. When n is 0 the the expression inside the if 
// evaluates to a nonzero value/true and "n is between 1 and 10" is printed.
